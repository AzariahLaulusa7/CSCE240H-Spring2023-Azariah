Question: Who is at risk?


Answer:

	*Who is at risk?*
		Where are you going?
		Rabid dogs are a problem in many countries around the world, including most of Africa,
	 Asia, and parts of Central and South America. Although any mammal can transmit rabies, dog
	 bites are how most travelers get rabies.
		Activities that may increase a traveler's chances of rabies infection include:
			-Camping or exploring caves (spelunkers)
			-Working with animals (veterinarians, animal handlers, field biologists, or laboratory workers handling animal specimens)
			-Long-term travelers and expatriates
		Children are more likely to get infected because they often play with animals and may
	 not report bites.
		Rabies in dogs is rare in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, and most European
	 countries.
