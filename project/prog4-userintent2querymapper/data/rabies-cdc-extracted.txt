Rabies 

	*What is rabies?*
		Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus. You can get rabies if you
	 are bitten or scratched by an animal with rabies.
		In the United States, rabies is mostly found in wild animals like bats, raccoons, skunks,
	 and foxes. However, in many other countries around the world, bites from dogs (including puppies)
	 are the main source of rabies infections in people. Most people who die of rabies
	 were bitten by a dog with rabies.
		Rabies affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). Without appropriate medical care,
	 rabies causes brain disease and death. Once symptoms of rabies appear, the disease is nearly
	 always fatal. For this reason, preventing animal bites and receiving prompt medical care is especially
	 important.
		Early rabies symptoms include weakness or discomfort, fever, and headache. There may be discomfort or
	 a prickling or itching sensation at the place of the bite. Within days, an infected
	 person may become anxious, confused, and agitated. As a person gets sicker, they may become
	 delirious, hallucinate, be unable to sleep, and unable to swallow or quench their thirst.

	*Who is at risk?*
		Where are you going?
		Rabid dogs are a problem in many countries around the world, including most of Africa,
	 Asia, and parts of Central and South America. Although any mammal can transmit rabies, dog
	 bites are how most travelers get rabies.
		Activities that may increase a traveler's chances of rabies infection include:
			-Camping or exploring caves (spelunkers)
			-Working with animals (veterinarians, animal handlers, field biologists, or laboratory workers handling animal specimens)
			-Long-term travelers and expatriates
		Children are more likely to get infected because they often play with animals and may
	 not report bites.
		Rabies in dogs is rare in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, and most European
	 countries.

	*What can travelers do to prevent rabies?*
		Travelers can protect themselves from rabies by taking the following steps:

			Avoid animals when traveling

			-Don't touch dogs, puppies, or other animals. This goes for strays as well as pets. Not all countries require pets to be vaccinated against rabies. Even animals that appear healthy can spread rabies.
			-Supervise children closely, especially around dogs and puppies, cats and kittens, and wildlife.
			-If you travel with your pet, watch it closely. Do not allow it around other local pets or wild animals.
			-Avoid bringing animals home to the United States. Dogs and cats may be infected with rabies but not show signs until several days or months later. If you do decide to bring an animal with you to the United States, be aware of ("https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/index.html")  and("https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-and-animal-product-import-information/live-animal-imports/import-live-animals")  ("https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/index.html") .
			-If you are traveling to work with animals, bring and wear appropriate protective gear.
			-For more information, see ("https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/be-safe-around-animals") .

			Act quickly if you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal

			-Immediately wash all bites and scratches well. Use plenty of soap and running water.
			-Seek medical care immediately, even if you don't feel sick or the wound does not look serious.
			-To prevent rabies, start treatment immediately. Treatment for rabies includes getting a vaccine after you have been bitten. Even if you were vaccinated before your trip, you still need to seek care if you get bitten or scratched by an animal.
			-Be prepared to travel back to the United States or to another area to receive treatment. Vaccination and medicine for rabies exposure is not available everywhere in the world.

			Pre-travel rabies vaccine

		For some travelers, it may make sense to get the rabies vaccine before your trip.
	 Check if rabies vaccine is recommended for ("https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list") .
		The rabies vaccine is given in two shots. The second dose is given seven days
	 after the first dose. Even if you are vaccinated against rabies, if you are bitten
	 or scratched by an ("https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/animals/index.html")  while traveling, you need to
	 seek medical care immediately and get two booster doses of the vaccine.

			Consider medical evacuation insurance

		Rabies vaccine is not available in all countries. Medical evacuation insurance can cover the cost
	 of transferring you home or to the nearest destination where care can be obtained. For
	 more information, see ("https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/insurance")  and ("https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/health-care-abroad/travel-insurance-travel-health-insurance-and-medical-evacuation-insurance") .

	*After Travel*
		If you traveled and feel sick, particularly if you have a fever, talk to a healthcare provider and tell them about your travel. 
		If you need medical care abroad, see ("https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/getting-health-care-abroad") .
